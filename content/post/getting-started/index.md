## Struture affects Function

Stem cells have the capability to differentiate into distinct cell types. The unique combination of molecular and structural modifications which constitute the epigenome alter the likelihood of expression of various genes leading to various distinct phenotypes. DNA methylation (which affect DNA directly) and histone modifications (which affect the DNA indirectly) are among the molecular modifications that modulate gene transcription. In addition to molecular modifications, the chromatin architecture is also an important predictor of transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity in stem cells.

A stem cell can be thought of as a Rubik’s cube with different chromatin domains as well as molecular modifications, represented by each small colored cube. The stem cell epigenome is highly plasticity and the pieces of the cube can be moved around allowing distinct domains and combinations of molecular modifications to come together and consequently creating different functional states (cell types).  As the stem cell differentiates, this flexibility to move the pieces of the rubik’s cube around decreases. In other words, inherent plasticity in a stem cell is reduced as it reaches a stable differentiated state.
