##  

Stem cells have the capability to differentiate into distinct cell types. The unique combination of molecular and structural modifications which constitute the epigenome alter the likelihood of expression of genes leading to different phenotypes. DNA methylation (which affect DNA directly) and histone modifications (which affect the DNA indirectly) are amomg some of the molecular modifications that modulate gene transcription. In addition to molecular modifications, the structural modifications are also an important predictor of transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity in stem cells. When it comes to structural aspects of the epigenome we can think of the chromatin organization, which is DNA wrapped around proteins packed differntially at different length scales.

A stem cell can be thought of as a Rubikâ€™s cube with different chromatin domains as well as molecular modifications, represented by each small colored cube. The stem cell epigenome is highly plastic and the pieces of the cube can be moved around allowing distinct domains or genomic regions and combinations of molecular modifications to come together and consequently creating different functional states (cell types).  As the stem cell differentiates, this flexibility to move the pieces of the rubikâ€™s cube around decreases. In other words, inherent plasticity in a stem cell is reduced as it reaches a stable differentiated state.
