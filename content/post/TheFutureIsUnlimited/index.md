Recently, I was trying to book a Lyft ride to get home from a vaccination appointment. The app showed limited availability as there were no drivers available for pick up at the given location. It was dark and I was afraid of walking around in an unfamiliar neighborhood. After waiting for almost 40 minutes, I was able to finally get a ride on Uber. During the ride, I contemplated how such applications have blended with our life so seamlessly. This is just one of the examples of the many things we take for granted on a regular basis since we know that such technology is not going away anytime soon and is only going to get better with time. Think about the last time you scrolled through YouTube, Twitter, or Instagram, mindlessly going through the enormous amount of content that may never end until you switch off the device. On the other hand, remember when you had a polaroid? you would meticulously set the landscape for how you would like the photograph to turn out and then take enough time to capture it. With such high-quality cameras in every smartphone now, we take several shots of the same scene, save the best shot and then store it in a cloud with the rest of the million images that we rarely go back to. 

Our brain is wired in a way such that we experience a sense of calm and comfort in having more than enough. Following this idea, a healthy way of thinking is with an “abundance mindset”. An abundance mindset is about thinking that there is a limitless universe of learning, ideas worth pursuing, and opportunities for growth throughout your lifetime. In contrast, “a scarcity mindset” considers opportunities are like gold supply- limited and that if this one person claims 60% of the gold, I only have the rest of the 40% (which may also decrease over time) to shoot for. With such a mindset, when we realize that something isn’t as common as we perceived, we settle for the best we can get at the time. In other scenarios, such a mindset may also prevent action. Not applying for the job of your interest thinking that there are too many skilled competitors applying for a limited number of positions. The focus with this mindset gravitates towards what you do not have. An abundance mindset keeps moving, knowing that if one opportunity doesn’t hit the mark, there are endless more in the offing.

Every day we make choices.  Choices that either moves us a step forward or take us a few steps back. Imagine if you had to predict your ability to reach your future goals, with each data point being the choices in the past. Your ability to estimate the likelihood of an uncertain event improves as more points are added. Analogous to the law of large numbers, eventually no matter what your choices have been if you keep moving, adding more data points and experiences along the way, you are more likely to have learned and reached closer to your goal considerably more than if you had not. The key is therefore to keep moving and believing that you will get where you want to.

Altogether, I remind myself of these two lessons almost every day to move towards an abundance mindset:

**1.	Be grateful and focus on what you have.**
As many countries are still struggling to fight COVID-19, I feel grateful to be fully vaccinated and be living in a safe environment with my loved ones. It is important to pause and reflect on yourself to identify and hone your key strengths and skills even further.

**2.	Focus on what you can achieve and exhaust all the unlimited resources out there to take the next step.**
Remember that every wall is a door and that opportunities and possibilities towards success are limitless. 

**Keep moving, you will get there.**
