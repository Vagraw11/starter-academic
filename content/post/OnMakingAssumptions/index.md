‘‘The presumption of innocence is the legal principle that one is considered innocent until proven guilty.’’ Being a part of the scientific research community, I am no stranger to the idea of making assumptions. We run experiments to test a given hypothesis which is usually based on a previously observed phenomenon. Fundamentally, a hypothesis is an “assumption subject to verification”. Since it is often easier to prove things wrong than right, statistical methods are routinely used to reject or disprove a given null hypothesis. Usually, a null hypothesis is a general statement that is assumed to be true until disproved using further evidence. In other words, as stated before, a defendant being questioned is always presumed to be innocent until proven guilty as the trial unfolds. 

This idea of performing statistical tests to reject a null hypothesis made me think about the assumptions we make about the people in our lives and the subsequent decision we make to about their presence in our lives. I have realized that we sometimes label people, that too in a negative way, based on our interactions with them and the resultant impression they leave on us. However, these assumptions that we make might bias our future interactions with them and even our relationship with them, in a broader sense. What if we leave all our assumptions behind, and focus on making them right? What if we presume that every human being in the world has the best interest at heart? This not only allows us to be more understanding of people’s actions and also more forgiving of the missteps they may have in the future. In other words, all the good is already out there, and we all need to make a conscious effort to leave behind the negative assumptions to be able to see this quality in people. Can you think of a time when you failed to understand people when they may not have been wrong? Perhaps, you made a ‘bad’ assumption. There may have also been times when people disappointed you, when you made a ‘good’ assumption. I don’t know about you, but I prefer the latter scenario. I would like to continue making these ‘good’ assumptions and be able to better judge of people who prove them wrong by showing me who they truly are.
Maya Angelou once said, “when people show you who they are, believe them.” I would say that until they do, believe in the good in them. Otherwise, you know the drill.
