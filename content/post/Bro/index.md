title: Easier said than done 
# subtitle: Stem Cells have the potential to differentiated into multiple cell types. As Conrad Waddington had suggested, a stem call can be thought of as a ball on top of the hill with high potential energy and as this ball rolls down the hill it attains stable minima. The opposite of this process is called reprogramming where in you go from this differentiated state to a stem cell state. Eventhough these cells are so different, both transcriptionally and phenotypically i.e they have different gene expression profiles and different function they share the same DNA sequence. Therefore, these functional differences may be linked with both molecular and structural changes in the genome that don’t change the underlying DNA sequence.

As I was devouring a slice of the Lou, my favorite Deep Dish pizza during a holiday party at work, I remember zoning out from a conversation with my colleagues. I remember my manager telling me to not be too serious all the time. I have a habit of zoning out of situations- while having conversations with people, playing games with friends, and several other situations. What I mean by zoning out is that I start thinking about something else and forget that I am in a room full of people who might find it weird looking at my expressionless face, weirdly focusing in one direction yet not being present in the immediate moment. I think it is a common theme among people who live more than one life. I think that I am a citizen of two completely different worlds. As a young Indian girl who moved to the states (world # 2) to pursue ‘higher education’, but goes back to India now and then to her world #1. For someone, who has two very distinct worlds to live in, they can never fully be present in one or the other. How do I live for now? Its like quantum physics, where you can never tell the position of an electron at a given time. Similarly you never know which world I am thinking of in a given moment, regardless of my location.

When I see a new kind of flower on the Northwestern campus, I think about how it would make my mom who loves gardening excited. I think about how she would react if she saw them. When I am in India at home, I think of my friends back in world #2 and get busy capturing all the ‘OMG, did that just happened’ moments that I think they might find hilarious. There are further smaller worlds within these 2 major worlds, for example, my work and my hobbies. When I am taking public transport to work, I think of the next experiment I should be doing. Or while making some abstract art, I think of how it looks similar to the images I took using the microscope. To calm this chaotic mind, I often find myself listening to Oprah’s podcats, Supersoul conversations where she keeps reiterating the idea of being ‘more fully present’. ‘’Easier said than done’’, I think to myself. I feel like I can never truly be fully present in one of these worlds that I think I belong to. It is easy to say that you should be completely focussed on the moment you are in. However, I have always found this way of thinking extremely one dimensional. None of the good ideas that I have ever had have emerged from the time when I was so focused on one task. They have instead been a byproduct of me zoning out on numerous occasions. Archimedes thought of buoyant forces while he was in a tub of water when he realized that the water that was displaced by him was proportional to his weight. Further, being more fully present gets even more difficult now, given the need for people to take innumerable pictures and post them on social media, thinking of the number of likes I want or what the title of the post should be instead of enjoying the moment. We have all been a victim of this crime. The crime of not being fully present.

What I have realized is that the creativity come from switching between different thoughts or themes. However, in order to develop these ideas further, deep work is required. Deep work comes when you don’t let the initial phases of boredome stop you.

Just as I was reading a book near the lake, I noticed two little rabbits playing with each other. Although, I was looking at the rabbits, I was thinking about writing this piece. I was thinking about writing for a while now since I have realized that it needs a lot of improvement and the first step to improvement is to practice, make mistakes, and then get better over time. But, you know what, it is easier said than done. Nevertheless, I will keep going.
