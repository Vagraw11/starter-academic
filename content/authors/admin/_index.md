I work at the intersection of mutliplexed whole-tissue imaging, AI-driven image analysis and spatial statistics to uncover mechanisms underlying complex biological systems. My doctoral research expertise encompasses high-resolution molecular imaging, functional genomics experiments, and the application of physics-based statistical analysis to elucidate the intricacies of 3D genome architecture.

Through this blog I hope to summarize some of the recent developments in the realms of my interst- aging, epigenomics and AI, and their intersection, and more importantly, articulate ideas for future directions from my lens. 
The views and opinions expressed on this personal blog are entirely my own and do not reflect those of any affiliated organization or entity.
